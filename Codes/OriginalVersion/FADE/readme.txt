========================================================================

This is a demonstration of the Fog Aware Density Evaluator (FADE).
It is an implementation of the FADE in the reference.
The algorithm is described in:
L. K. Choi, J. You, and A. C. Bovik, "Referenceless Prediction of Perceptual Fog Density and Perceptual Image Defogging,"
IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 24, no. 11, pp. 3888-3901, Nov. 2015.

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please
refer to its original source (cite our paper and our web page at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/fog/FADE_release.zip).

Input : A test 8bits/pixel color image loaded in a 3-D array.
Output: A Perceptual fog density score of the image. Lower value represents a lower perceptual fog density.

Usage:

1. Load the image, for example
  image = imread('test_image1.png'); 

2. Call this function to calculate the perceptual fog density score:
  density = FADE(image)
  [density, density_map] = FADE(image);  // for density and density_map.

Sample demo is also shown through FADE_example.m


Files (provided with release):
MATLAB files:  FADE.m, FADE_example.m CE.m border_in.m border_out.m 
Image files:   test_image1.png test_image2.jpg test_image3.jpg
Data files:    natural_foggy_image_features_ps8.mat natural_fogfree_image_features_ps8.mat 

This release version of FADE is based on a corpus of 500 fog-free images and another corpus of 500 foggy images
with patch size set to 8 X 8. The foggy and fog-free images that were used in our experiments can be found at
http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/fog/index.html.

This code has been tested on Windows.
